The example depicts performing aggregate statistics on multiple parties. In this example we use a single dataset for all three dataowners ,
but it could be extended to different datasets that have the same column names on which aggregate statistics could be performed together. 
To run the example 

1. Run the three dataowners 

   ```python3 datasource1.py```
   
   Similarly run the scripts for datasource2 and 3 

2. Run the analysis script
